**Synthetic plants** (Synthetic RGB-D data for plant segmentation) is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 10000 images with 326754 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *leaf*, *petiole*, *stem,* and other: **fruit**.

Each image in the Synthetic plants dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (10000 images). The dataset was released in 2018.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 4 classes:
