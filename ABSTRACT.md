The **Synthetic Plants** dataset consists of generated RGB-D images sized at 224x224 pixels, focusing on plants. Each plant is categorized into one of five classes: *leaf*, *petiole*, *stem*, *fruit*, and background. This dataset finds applications in a range of Computer Vision and Deep Learning projects, including plant detection, object measurement utilizing depth data, robotics, and the advancement of smart agricultural technologies.
