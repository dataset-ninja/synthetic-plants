Nowadays, AI has revolutionized almost all fields. But, the lack of data was and still represents a wall in front of this revolution. Fortunately, this problem can be solved by generating synthetic data to train our models on and using fine-tuning with the few available real data that we possess. This dataset could be used in different Computer Vision and Deep Learning projects such: Plant detection, Measure of objects using Depth, Robotics and also for making agriculture smart.
